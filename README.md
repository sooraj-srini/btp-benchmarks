# Introduction

This is a repository intended to document the benchmarks of the following algorithms on the Tabular Benchmarks:

- DLGN
- LCN
- Latent Trees
- TAO
- Soft Decision Trees*


# Todo

- [ ] Benchmark on all 16 binary classification datasets provided in Tabular Benchmarks
- [ ] Benchmark Soft Decision Trees
- [ ] Find the existing benchmarks given in the paper for other models
- [ ] Improve TAO to not throw liblinear convergence issues
- [ ] Improve TAO to use another obliue decision tree learning algorithm.

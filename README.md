# Introduction

This is a repository intended to document the benchmarks of the following algorithms on the Tabular Benchmarks:

- DLGN
- DLGN VT
- LCN
- Latent Trees
- TAO
- Soft Decision Trees*

The benchmarks are done on the 16 binary classification datasets provided in the Tabular Benchmarks. 

The repository also contains the code for examining the performances of XGBoost versus the DLGN for these three criteria: robustness to uninformative features, ability to learn irregular features and sensitive to the orientation of the data. 

All the code for the project is found in src/ . The results of these experiments is found in results/.
